# Stock-Bot

Built a program to predict the closing price of any stock for the next day using a neural network. 

Processes 60 days or more of historical data from YF API, then overlays its predicted trendline over the historical trendline on a graph to 
display the modelâ€™s accuracy.

I made this program to assist me while trading stock options (avg monthly income: $700 as of April 2021)
